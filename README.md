### 1. AWS Account Creation <a name="aws-account-creation"></a>

#### 1.1 Sign Up for a New AWS Account

Follow the official AWS guidelines to sign up for a new AWS account. Ensure that the account has the necessary permissions to create and manage AWS resources.

#### 1.2 Permissions

Verify that the AWS account has the required permissions:

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for creating and managing S3 buckets and EC2 instances.

---

### 2. Terraform Code Writing <a name="terraform-code-writing"></a>

#### 2.1 Provision AWS Resources

Write Terraform code to provision the following AWS resources:

- An S3 bucket with versioning and public access disabled.
- An EC2 instance with a security group allowing only SSH access from your IP address.

Ensure that the Terraform code is organized and adheres to best practices.

#### 2.2 Terraform Variables

Consider using Terraform variables for values that may change, such as AWS region, S3 bucket name, and EC2 instance configurations.

#### 2.3 Terraform Backend Configuration

Configure Terraform backend to store the state remotely. This could be an S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, or other suitable backend.

---

### 3. GitHub Repository Setup <a name="github-repository-setup"></a>

#### 3.1 Create a New GitHub Repository

Create a new GitHub repository to store your Terraform configuration files.

#### 3.2 .gitignore File

Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude files that should not be committed. Typical entries include Terraform state files, temporary files, and system-specific files.

#### 3.3 README.md

Include a `README.md` file providing information about the purpose of the repository, how to use the Terraform code, and any prerequisites.

---

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow <a name="github-actions-workflow"></a>

#### 4.1 Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository that triggers on push events to the main branch.

#### 4.2 Workflow Steps

Define the workflow steps:

- Install Terraform: Set up the required version of Terraform for the workflow.
- Initialize Terraform: Initialize the Terraform working directory.
- Apply Terraform Configuration: Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure.

#### 4.3 Secrets

Consider using GitHub Secrets for sensitive information, such as AWS credentials, to enhance security.

#### 4.4 Workflow Documentation

Include comments and documentation within the workflow file to explain each step and its purpose.

---

Following these steps will help you set up AWS infrastructure using Terraform and maintain a structured and version-controlled workflow using GitHub.
